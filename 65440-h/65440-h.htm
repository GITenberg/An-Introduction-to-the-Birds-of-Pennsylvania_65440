<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">PREFATORY NOTE</span></h2>
<p>I have written this book for those who are beginning a
study of birds in Pennsylvania; or for those who, after some
study in a certain region, wish to know more about the birds
in other sections of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>This book is not intended to be a complete reference work.
The descriptions of the birds and statements of their status
are as brief as I felt I could make them under the circumstances.
Many species of birds which have been recorded in
Pennsylvania are not even mentioned. These are omitted
so as to simplify the list for the beginner, who is confronted
with a sufficiently formidable array of new and strange names
as it is. All important species are, however, included.</p>
<p>Colored illustrations throughout this hand manual would,
of course, have been desirable, but their cost is great, and the
pen drawings are adequate for field-work; perhaps, in fact,
even better than fully colored drawings which often lead the
beginner to expect too much from the glimpses he may have
of birds in the field.</p>
<p>Throughout the manual I have attempted to stress the
points which are of importance to the field student, and have
tried to eliminate material which might lead to confusion.</p>
<p>Thorough, detailed works on Pennsylvania birds are
needed. Such volumes, one on western Pennsylvania, by
W. E. Clyde Todd, of the Carnegie Museum, Pittsburgh, and
one on eastern Pennsylvania, by Dr. Witmer Stone, of the
Philadelphia Academy of Arts and Sciences, are in the
making now. But it may be years before these completed
volumes are ready for distribution, and in the meantime our
budding ornithologists are carrying on their studies handicapped
by a lack of any sort of reference work which is up-to-date,
understandable, simple and local in its treatment,
and within reach of those of average means. This volume
has been prepared to meet this need.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_viii">viii</div>
<p>It is hoped that the ornithological notes of those who use
this manual may be so conscientiously written and so carefully
kept that they will be of value in the final preparation
of the larger, more exhaustive works which are to follow.</p>
<p>I have a suggestion to make to those who would like to
make this volume more attractive and somewhat personal in
character. Why not, as certain birds are identified, color in
the pen-and-ink drawings with water-color or crayon so that
they will greet the eye in color as the pages are turned? The
paper used is such that colors may be applied with safety, if
care be exercised. Children, in particular, will greatly enjoy
this feature of their bird-study work. Teachers who like to
combine elementary art work with nature study will welcome
such a suggestion. A book which has, in a sense, been thus
personally illustrated, becomes invaluable to the owner.</p>
<p>I should like to extend a word of gratitude to the following
people who have helped me in the preparation of this volume:
Captain George Finlay Simmons, of the Cleveland Museum
of Natural History; Mr. Wharton Huber, of the Philadelphia
Academy of Natural Sciences; Mr. Robert McFarland, of
the Mount Pleasant Press, Harrisburg; Miss Evangel Sutton,
my sister; Mr. Leo A. Luttringer, Jr., my assistant; and Miss
Effie Riemensnyder, of Harrisburg.</p>

<h1 title=""><span class="smaller"><span class="smaller">AN INTRODUCTION TO THE</span>
<br />BIRDS OF PENNSYLVANIA</span></h1>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">A WORD TO THE BEGINNER</span></h2>
<p>As you glance over the pages of this book you may say to
yourself, &ldquo;I can never learn all of these birds.&rdquo; This is a
natural attitude of mind upon the part of one to whom many
bird-names are new and who feels that he doesn&rsquo;t know
much about birds.</p>
<p>It may be reassuring to you to learn that most people
know more about birds than they realize. Already your
mind is full of common bird-names. You wouldn&rsquo;t be reading
this book had you not already learned a good deal about
some birds.</p>
<p>Here is a bit of good advice. Instead of taking this book
to the field with you in the hope that you may accurately
identify every bird you see, suppose you choose eight or
ten birds which you do not know, but about which you wish
to learn, and concentrate upon these. You already know the
Bluebird, the Robin, the Crow. Suppose you try now the
Wood Thrush, the Towhee, the Meadowlark. Look these
up in the book, find out whether you may expect to see them
at the time you are to make your trip of discovery, learn
where to look for them, what to look for when they appear,
something about what they will say as they call or sing&mdash;and
fasten these facts in your mind. If you adopt this procedure,
you will not be misled into identifying some bird of
the deep woods as a Meadowlark, or a bird of the open field
as a Wood Thrush. Some birds will puzzle you, of course,
but as you continue your study these problems will be solved.</p>
<p>As a serious bird student you will, first of all, want to be
able to describe a bird accurately, using some acceptable
scientific terms. Some of these will be new to you, but they
will all become understandable in a short time. On the next
page is a chart showing the names of the bird&rsquo;s parts. You
should become so familiar with these words that they will
not confuse you.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>Many books give complete color keys which are to help
the beginner. I do not believe much in these, because I have
always found them tedious and difficult. I believe that good
sketches obviate much of the need of such keys.</p>

<p class="pcap">Topography of a Bird</p>
</div>
<p>In making your studies be careful not to expect to find
birds during seasons when they do not normally occur. On
the other hand, if you identify a bird at a time which is not
indicated in this manual, special note should be made, for
pioneer records such as these are valuable to the author who
wants to gather together all data, and the last word has not
yet been said upon all the movements of even our commonest
species.</p>
<h3 id="c3">BIRD-SONGS</h3>
<p>It is my belief that but few people altogether lack a sense
of tune. Some of my students at the University of Pittsburgh
had difficulty, I remember, in diagramming bird-songs; but
with a little practice you will be able to jot down syllables
which will help you to recall bird-songs. The well-known
names <i>Chickadee</i>, <i>Ph&oelig;be</i>, and <i>Killdeer</i> are all permanent
records of this very sort of syllabization of bird-songs&mdash;an
attempt to write down what the bird is saying. Sometimes
a bird will be heard again and again before it is seen. If my
notes concerning songs are at all accurate, some of these will
help you to find birds which you might have difficulty in
identifying from appearance alone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<h3 id="c4">NOTE-BOOKS</h3>
<p>Write down all sorts of notes, be they ever so incomplete.
Make sketches of birds as you see them; diagram the songs
and call-notes. Keep all that you write as accurate and free
from imagination as possible. Do not accredit a bird with
certain colors until you see them.</p>
<p>A note-book may take the form of a diary wherein is
stated the temperature of the day, the weather conditions,
the length and route of your field-trip, and the birds which
you saw, together with notes upon them. Or, your system
may be more elaborate, with a separate sheet for each species
whereon you put all the data which you accumulate, more or
less, perforce, in chronological order. The principal point to
remember is that notes should be written while they are
fresh in the mind, on the spot, if possible, to avoid inaccuracies.</p>
<h3 id="c5">SPECIMENS</h3>
<p>Only a few ornithologists can have a complete collection
of birds for reference. Everyone can save feathers of birds,
or old nests, however, and when birds are found dead, they
may be saved as specimens, if a permit for holding them is
requested from the State Game Commission. When I was a
lad I saved feathers which I found in the woods and had a
large collection of these. Some of them, I later found, were
all that were needed in authenticating a good record.</p>
<p>You will find it helpful to visit a good museum occasionally,
so as to have a close view of the birds you have been reading
about, or studying under difficulty, in the field. Here you
will see clearly the color patterns, the anatomical characteristics,
and the actual size of the birds that have puzzled you.</p>
<h3 id="c6">FIELD-GLASSES</h3>
<p>A good binocular, preferably one which magnifies about
six times, is a great aid to the amateur. The field of the glass,
its illumination, ease of adjustment, and such points should
be investigated before the purchase is made. A well-made
glass with good lenses is probably the best in the long run, even
though it be more expensive. Glasses should be handled carefully.
They should have a good carrying-case, and should not
be left lying in the sun nor exposed to the rain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<h3 id="c7">BOOKS</h3>
<p>Many excellent standard works upon birds are available.
When I was a youngster I wore out three volumes of Dr.
Frank M. Chapman&rsquo;s <i>Bird-Life</i>; I devoured the reading
matter, cut up the pictures, and studied the technique of the
artist who had painted them. By the time I had destroyed
the third copy of this helpful volume, I knew the birds
treated there pretty well. Chapman&rsquo;s <i>Handbook of Birds of
Eastern North America</i> is a desk-side companion today. The
little pocket volumes called <i>Bird Guides</i>, by C. A. Reed, are
helpful; but the color-plates in them have been used so many
times that they are worn out, with the result that the colors
are often very misleading. Dr. B. H. Warren&rsquo;s volumes on
the <i>Birds of Pennsylvania</i>, published in 1888 and 1890, contain
much of value and interest, including a series of colored
pictures which always elicit praise. These volumes, while
interesting historically, do not meet the needs of the Pennsylvania
bird student today, in the light of present knowledge.
The excellent state publications <i>Birds of New York</i> (Eaton)
and <i>Birds of Massachusetts</i> (Forbush), are magnificently
illustrated and are well worth possessing; they treat of many
of the species found in Pennsylvania. Books on general
aspects of ornithology which you will find useful are:
Wetmore&rsquo;s <i>The Migrations of Birds</i>, Ball&rsquo;s <i>Bird Biographies</i>,
Blanchan&rsquo;s <i>Bird Neighbors</i> and <i>Birds That Hunt and Are
Hunted</i>, Chapman&rsquo;s <i>What Bird is That?</i>, Coues&rsquo; <i>Key to North
American Birds</i>, the National Geographic Society&rsquo;s <i>Book
of Birds</i>, and Forbush&rsquo;s <i>Useful Birds and Their Protection</i>.</p>
<h3 id="c8">MAGAZINES</h3>
<p>The proceedings of the Delaware Valley Ornithological
Society, published under the title <i>Cassinia</i>, contain a wealth
of material interesting to the Pennsylvania student. <i>The
Cardinal</i>, journal of the Audubon Society of the Sewickley
Valley, and a well-edited periodical, contains articles of interest
chiefly to workers in western Pennsylvania; <i>The Auk</i>,
<i>The Wilson Bulletin</i>, <i>Bird-Lore</i>, <i>The Oologist</i>, <i>The Condor</i>
(western), and <i>Nature Magazine</i>, all are likely to contain
articles of interest to Pennsylvania bird students.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<h3 id="c9">BIRD HIKES</h3>
<p>Early-morning hikes are good, but activity among birds
is high, as a rule, until 10 o&rsquo;clock <span class="sc">A.M.</span>, or later, so you need
not be in haste to get out at 4 o&rsquo;clock, unless you have to go
far. The trained bird student so comes to depend upon songs
that he stays out as long as the birds are singing. Windy
days are poor, because the birds are shy. In gentle rains,
birds will often be very active and tame. Toward evening,
birds often become active and vociferous again. Only a few
of our birds sing during the heat of the midsummer noon.</p>
<h3 id="c10">IN THE FIELD</h3>
<p>Winter is an ideal time to begin bird-study, because there
are no leaves and because the birds are few and not difficult
to identify. If you learn the winter birds thoroughly, you
will be ready for the rush of the spring as old favorites return
and new friends appear.</p>
<p>Midsummer is often a disappointing season because birds
are silent and in poor feather. At this time you will be able
to study the plumages of the young birds, however, and you
will find much of interest in watching the affairs of family
life. Migrant shore-birds should be watched during late
summer.</p>
<p>Fall is the season of trials. Now come the restless, sombre-colored
hordes, most of them silent save for a few brief call-notes.
When you can easily identify all the fall birds, you are
a pretty good ornithologist.</p>
<p>In approaching a bird, common sense will warn you that
you should be as quiet as possible. You should be obscurely
dressed, and if you can go under, around, or between bushes,
rather than through them, you will cause less disturbance.
Often the best way to study birds is to find a pleasant, somewhat
hidden spot and remain there for an hour, watching all
that comes by. A good bird student, in the course of his walk,
will try to visit as many different kinds of country as he can;
he will visit the ponds and marshes, the grape-vine thickets,
the open fields, and the hemlock woods of his neighborhood.
He knows that in these different regions he is likely to find
different birds. In fact, unless he does carefully study <i>all</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
of these regions, he is not thoroughly studying the bird-life
of his locality.</p>
<p>You may have trouble in seeing some birds, though you
pursue them ever so tirelessly. Try kissing the back of your
hand in such a manner as to imitate the cries of a young or
wounded bird. This sound will often arouse the curiosity of
the wariest bird and he will come close. I thus made a
squeaking sound once and a Robin hit me with full force on
the neck; she was so convinced that I had one of her young
in my dreaded clutches that she gave stern battle! These
squeaking cries sometimes draw even the birds of prey.</p>
<h3 id="c11">VALUE OF PENNSYLVANIA BIRDS</h3>
<p>Birds are of great value from the economic standpoint.
The insects, destructive mammals and reptiles, and weed-seeds
which they destroy are all enemies of man. It is
amazing that in the scheme of nature certain birds should
patrol the air, others the fields, others the trees, others the
forest-floor, and so on, so that all outdoors is, in a sense, cared
for by our feathered friends. It has been said that our very
existence depends upon these birds who make it possible for
the trees, the flowers, and the grain-fields to grow. And all
the while these same creatures are delighting us with their
beautiful colors and their cheerful songs.</p>
<p>Game-birds are important in Pennsylvania, with 700,000
hunters faring forth each fall. In addition to our popular
game-birds, the Bob-White, Wild Turkey, and Ruffed
Grouse, the Game Commission has introduced the Ring-necked
Pheasant and Hungarian Partridge. These foreigners
relieve the burden of shooting from our native game.</p>
<p>From the economic standpoint only a few birds in Pennsylvania
may be said to be thoroughly undesirable. The
Goshawk is a savage destroyer of small game and poultry.
His smaller cousins, the Sharp-shinned Hawk and Cooper&rsquo;s
Hawk, are killers. The Great Horned Owl is destructive at
times. Other hawks and owls, the Crow, Kingfisher, Starling,
and other species have some destructive or undesirable
traits, but they are not altogether bad.</p>
<p>Our valuable song and insectivorous birds have been
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
protected since 1858. Certain migratory birds, such as the
loons, grebes, herons, and gulls, have been protected since
1900 by the International Bird Treaty with Canada. Today
we protect one admittedly destructive bird&mdash;the Raven,
because it is so rare and because of its fame in literary circles.</p>
<h3 id="c12">HELPING OUR BIRD FRIENDS</h3>
<p>We may encourage birds to live about us, if we bear in
mind their needs. In winter we may feed the Chickadees,
Cardinals, Downy Woodpeckers, and other birds which live
in our neighborhood. We may tack pieces of suet on a
sheltered branch and scatter grain and grit on &ldquo;feeding
counters.&rdquo; When snow is on the ground the birds have considerable
difficulty in getting enough food, and our assistance
will sometimes keep them from starvation. Feeding-shelters
may be very simple, or they may be elaborate, but
they should be placed and built so as to serve the needs of
the birds best. A feeding-shelf built at a window furnishes a
very attractive and useful device.</p>
<p>Before spring is upon us we should erect nesting-boxes
for the Purple Martins, Bluebirds, and House Wrens we wish
to attract. Those who are interested in securing specifications
for these boxes should write to the Game Commission
at Harrisburg for their bulletin, &ldquo;A Year&rsquo;s Program for
Bird Protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spring we should think of the trees or shrubs which
will attract birds. A fruit-laden mulberry tree always
attracts birds in midsummer. Thick bushes placed in clumps
will almost surely lure nesting Catbirds or Chipping Sparrows;
a trumpet vine will mean Hummingbirds!</p>
<p>In midsummer the birds&rsquo; bath must be arranged. Such
a bath may be very simple. But it must not be deep, and the
edges should slope into the deeper water gradually. Remember
that the water should be changed frequently unless
a running stream is provided.</p>
<p>House cats and birds do not thrive together as a rule.
If you wish to make conditions as nearly ideal as possible
for your bird friends, you had better not keep a cat, for these
animals are, by nature, crafty and bloodthirsty, and they
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
will catch birds for &ldquo;sport,&rdquo; even though they are well fed.</p>
<p>If you carefully watch the birds, you will become aware of
their needs. You may find it necessary to shoot Starlings
occasionally if they persist in ousting Flickers from their
nests. You may have to plant sunflowers to attract Goldfinches;
you may find it desirable to allow part of your
property to grow up into weeds and bushes so that it may
furnish a home for some unusual bird neighbor. At my home
at Bethany, West Virginia, we have permitted raspberry
vines to grow on a hillside back of the house, and here Indigo
Buntings nest, within a few rods of the open windows!</p>
<h3 id="c13">LIFE-ZONES IN PENNSYLVANIA</h3>
<p>The term <i>Life-Zone</i> is used by scientists in referring to a
region where environmental conditions so react upon each
other as to form a suitable home for certain plant and animal
forms. A Life-Zone naturally has no hard and fast boundaries
as does a geographical zone; its boundaries are determined by
temperature, rainfall, soil, altitude, drainage, and innumerable
other factors, which so create a certain average whole as
to attract certain species of plants, birds, mammals, and so
forth, which in turn themselves become part of the environment,
and are responsible for the presence of certain forms.
These Life-Zones are, then, associations which naturally
develop in sections where similar conditions exist. In Pennsylvania
there are three or four of these associations. One,
noticeable in the southern and southwestern counties, has
been called the Carolinian Life-Zone. Here such birds as the
Carolina Wren, Cardinal, Tufted Tit, and Red-bellied Woodpecker
live. In much of Pennsylvania the Alleghenian Life-Zone
occurs, where the Least Flycatcher, Wilson&rsquo;s Thrush,
Swamp Sparrow, and Rose-breasted Grosbeak are to be found
in summer. Higher in the mountains is the Canadian Life-Zone;
here the Junco, Hermit Thrush, Red-breasted Nuthatch,
Wilson&rsquo;s Snipe, and Northern Water Thrush nest.
As you read this book, you will notice that many birds are to
be found in <i>northern or mountainous counties</i>; others in
<i>southern or less mountainous counties</i>, and so forth. This is
an indication of Life-Zone distribution.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<h3 id="c14">BIRD-MIGRATION IN PENNSYLVANIA</h3>
<p>Some of our winter birds spend the year round in one
region. Certain of them, like the Song Sparrow and Crow,
migrate to an extent, the nesting individuals moving southward
during winter, their place being taken by other individuals
of the same species from farther north. Some winter
birds, such as the Junco, Golden-crowned Kinglet, Brown
Creeper, and Tree Sparrow, visit us from the north and return
to their Canadian nesting-ground with the arrival of spring.
Most of our familiar summer birds spend the winter to the
southward, many of them in South America. They come to
us for a few months each year for the sole purpose of bringing
forth their young. Many species of birds pass through Pennsylvania
en route from their home in the south to their nesting-grounds
in the north, and back again in the fall.</p>
<p>By far the greater number of species migrate to an extent.
The phenomenon of bird-migration has caused many a
student to wonder. How did such a tremendous annual
movement originate? How do the birds endure their great
flights across bodies of water?</p>
<p>The probability is that the migration of birds developed
in past centuries as the food-supply in the tropics became
insufficient for all the nesting birds which tried to bring forth
their young there. Urged by the need for solitude and a good
food-supply, certain birds pushed out from the ancestral
range and established a new summer home. After the young
were reared, instinct drew them back to the region which was
familiar to them, and so great migration routes have developed.
Today the tiny Ruby-throated Hummingbird rears
his young in our woodlands, then returns to South America
with the young birds. Our Yellow Warbler, Red-eyed Vireo,
Purple Martin, Rose-breasted Grosbeak, Scarlet Tanager,
and many others, all go to South America.</p>
<p>Food-conditions, no doubt, have something to do with
migration movements. Birds are well clothed with feathers,
to be sure, but many of them depend on an insect diet, such
as would be difficult to secure during cold winters. Some of
our birds actually do not migrate if a food-supply is available.</p>
<p>Most of the smaller birds migrate at night, following
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
streams or mountain ranges. Swallows and hawks usually
migrate by day, ducks and geese by both day and night.
The Ohio, Delaware, and Susquehanna river valleys are
important routes of migration. The shore of Lake Erie is a
resting-ground for birds which have flown over this large
body of water. In fall, at Presque Isle, the trees may be alive
with birds which have just made the flight. The Atlantic
Coast is an important route of migration for many waterbirds.
Since Pennsylvania has no salt-water shore-line, we
do not find some species which are to be found along the coast
of New Jersey and Delaware.</p>
<p>Many birds which occur in abundance at Erie, in fall, rest
there until they are able to take another flight; then they
start southward for a feeding or resting-ground south of
Pennsylvania, and therefore skip over most of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>The distribution of birds and the constancy of their
migration routes is a source of much wonder to all of us.
Why should the two Palm Warblers, for instance, so invariably
be found each year, one to the eastward, one to the westward
of the mountains? Why should some birds be here in
fall and not in spring? Why should others be so variable in
numbers? If you keep careful notes upon the migratory
birds, you may eventually help to solve some of these
problems.</p>

<p class="pcap">Horned Grebe, Winter Plumage</p>
</div>
<p>The white on the sides of the head
and the white wing-patches distinguish
this species in winter plumage from the
Pied-billed Grebe; the gay spring
plumage of the Horned Grebe is unmistakable.
Look for this bright-eyed diver along the larger
waterways. Its ability in swimming under water causes it to evade
its enemies by disappearing beneath the surface rather than by
flying. Grebes have the interesting habit of swallowing their own
feathers as they moult, or as they pluck them out.</p>
<p><b>Holb&oelig;ll&rsquo;s Grebe</b> (<i>Colymbus holb&oelig;llii</i>), a much larger bird, is very
rare in Pennsylvania. In spring plumage it has a red-brown neck.
It is about twice as large as either the Horned or Pied-billed Grebe
and has a proportionately heavier and larger bill.</p>

<p>The Loon is at perfect ease in the water; on land it shuffles along,
using its wings as feet, and it cannot rise in flight from the ground.
It lives almost altogether on fish which it captures under water and
swallows entire. As a rule, it is to be seen far out from shore, floating
quietly. Easily it slips under the water, perhaps to reappear a
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
hundred yards or more from the point at which it went down. The
weird, laughing cry, which is famous in literature, is not often heard
in Pennsylvania, since the birds do not nest here.</p>
<p>In the hand, the Loon is easily recognized by its striking coloration
in spring; or in winter by its long, sharp bill and its large, webbed
feet; at a distance, in the water, it may be confused with a cormorant,
which has a hooked bill and a rather long tail, or with some
of the larger ducks which have shorter, more stubby bills.</p>
<p>The smaller <b>Red-throated Loon</b> (<i>Gavia stellata</i>), usually a rare

swift flight make them comparatively easy to identify, save in foggy
weather when the apparent size of birds in the field is apt to be

occur with some regularity along a marshy neck of land which
protrudes into the lake at the mouth of an inflowing stream. Here
the birds rest quietly, feeding in early morning and toward evening,
and flying about only when they are disturbed. They are usually
mated by the time they reach this latitude in the spring.</p>

<p>The male Wood Duck, thought by many to be the most beautiful
American bird, is a gorgeous creature. It is little wonder that an
Indian legend tells us that a little gray duck, while on a search for
happiness, swam into the end of the rainbow and came forth the
brilliant creature we now call the Wood Duck.</p>
<p>Agile almost as a perching bird, these ducks run about on the
ground, snapping up insects, or swim buoyantly in quiet pools near
the woodland they have selected as their summer home. In a cavity
in a tree, sometimes at considerable distance from the water and at
quite a height from the ground, the down-lined nest is built.</p>
<p>The young birds, it is said, clamber out of the nest and fall to the
ground as best they can, without being helped by either parent.
Surely, young birds which survive such an ordeal are prepared for
the later battles of life!</p>
<p>Wood Ducks are fond of acorns and of the seeds of many aquatic
plants. The young birds, like the adults, are amazingly agile and
run about like young chickens, bright-eyed, attractive, and so small
as to be fairly ludicrous as they race into the water for a swim!</p>

<p>For us, since the days of our
forefathers, and for the Red
Man who originally inhabited
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
Penn&rsquo;s Woods, the V-shaped spring flocks of Canada Geese have
heralded the breaking up of the winter, and, in the fall, the
coming of the cold season. Canada Geese migrate both by day and
night, but they are noticed at night more often than by day because
in the comparative stillness of the dark hours their loud, musical
bugling drifts down to us as we lie awake, thrilled at the sound.
Could we see the great birds, could we know the distant clime toward
which they are heading, some of the mystery might be dispelled;
but their long journey, their great bodies speeding along at
60 miles an hour or more, and their wide, swishing wings are only
suggested by the clamor and challenge that comes to us, holds us
spellbound, then gradually dies away as the flock passes on.</p>
<p>Canada Geese are not so aquatic in habit as are ducks. Large
flocks often descend to the fields where they feed upon grass or
sprouting grain and where they walk about in a dignified fashion.</p>
<p>It is supposed that an old gander always leads the migration
flocks. While this may not be the case, it is reasonable to assume
that adult birds, with their experience and intelligence, should
determine the movements of the flock. Canada Geese sometimes
fly in a line, sometimes abreast, but the V-formation is characteristic.</p>
<p>The <b>Greater Snow Goose</b> (<i>Chen hyperboreus nivalis</i>), a white bird
with black wing-tips, sometimes flies across Pennsylvania. It has
been recorded once or twice in huge flocks. The <b>White-fronted
Goose</b> (<i>Aner albifrons gambelli</i>), a gray goose with a white area at
the base of the bill, black spots on the belly, and yellow feet, occurs
rarely. The <b>Brant</b> (<i>Branta bernicla glaucogastra</i>), smallest of our
geese and similar to the Canada Goose but with only a suggestion
of a white band on the neck, occurs rarely. It is a maritime species,
not often noted inland.</p>

<p>A flock of swans flying in the sunlight is an inspiring spectacle.

<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>They sometimes migrate in immense flocks. In storms or on

of water.</p>
<p>At Harrisburg, swans sometimes spend the winter along the

<p class="pcap">American Bittern</p>
</div>
<p>The Bittern is a terrestrial heron and rarely
alights in trees. It may be confused with
the immature Black-crowned Night Heron,
which, unlike the Bittern, often perches on a
prominent branch or on a tree top.</p>
<p>To know the Bittern one must penetrate the swamp. From the
cat-tails, a great brown bird arises, green feet awkwardly dangling.
Rapidly the creature makes away, once it has started; perhaps it
utters a startled squawk as it jumps from the grass.</p>
<p>In the spring, male Bitterns have a remarkable courtship ceremony
which is accompanied by the queer sounds which have given
the bird most of its common names. These names, most of which are
very good renditions of the queer sounds the birds give, are: &ldquo;Bum
Cluck&rdquo; or &ldquo;Plum Pudd&rsquo;n.&rdquo; The familiar nicknames, &ldquo;Stake-Driver&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
and &ldquo;Thunder-Pump&rdquo; also suggest the sounds. While they give
these sounds, the male birds inflate their necks and fluff out their
feathers, as they strut and bow, and snap their bills.</p>
<p>The sitting mother bird depends greatly upon her remarkably
protective coloration. Taken unawares, the hunting Bittern will
stand erect with bill pointing skyward, realizing that its dull colors,
its streaked breast, and its sharp bill <i>all</i> resemble cat-tail leaves.
The eyes of a Bittern are so arranged that the bird can point its
bill straight up yet at the same time look directly at us as we
approach. Its golden-yellow eyes have a serpentine appearance.</p>
<p>Young Bitterns, in their ragged natal down, are odd creatures.
They clamber about their crude cradle, soon developing remarkable
strength in toes and feet.</p>
<p>The Bittern and young Black-crowned Night Heron are our only
large, brown herons; the Bittern has yellow eyes; the young Black-crown
has dark brown eyes.</p>

chestnut; lesser wing-coverts buffy; greater wing-coverts and secondaries

<p>The Least Bittern is one of our quietest, most retiring birds, and
is therefore but little known. It may occur regularly in cat-tail
swamps where it has never been seen, simply because no one ventures
into its damp, shadowy home among the high, green blades.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig34">
<img src="images/p14a.jpg" alt="" width="278" height="395" />
<p class="pcap">Least Bittern</p>
</div>
<p>It moves slowly, as a rule, and with marvelous control. As it
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
has very strong feet, it can climb up the cat-tail leaves where
it sometimes perches so as to survey its surroundings the better.</p>
<p>If startled, it flies up rapidly; but, like a Rail, it does not like to
fly far because its long, rather awkward wings appear to tire quickly,
and it drops back into its retreat, where it is usually difficult to find
it again.</p>
<p>The parent bird has the strange habit of destroying, and perhaps
eating, her eggs if they are disturbed. We found a nest containing
two fresh eggs at Sandy Lake, Mercer County. Upon returning, a
few hours later, I found but a few shells in the nest. I feel certain
the parent bird, either the male or female, had destroyed the eggs.</p>

<p>Reports concerning Sandhill Cranes in Pennsylvania usually
refer to this species, as cranes do not occur here. Cranes have an
elevated, short hind toe; the hind toe of a heron is on the same level
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
as the other toes, and therefore shows in the track. Herons fly
with their necks doubled back, except when they are springing into
the air or alighting; cranes always hold their necks straight out.</p>
<p>The Great Blue Heron is an expert fisherman. Statuesque, he
stands in the water, intently watching for fish, which he captures
with his great, powerful bill, and he can swallow a 14-inch fish without
great difficulty. He has favorite fishing-points, and here, in the
mud along the bank, his great tracks may be seen. If the bird
student wishes to see one of these herons he usually has but to wait
at such a point for the evening hour of fishing, and the wide-winged
bird, with neck drawn back into the body, and feet sticking straight
out behind, will fly deliberately down to the angling-grounds, and
there promptly devote himself to capturing a meal.</p>

call, which is a series of rapidly descending notes, is characteristic.</p>
<p>The <b>Yellow Rail</b> (<i>Coturnicops noveboracensis</i>) is smaller than the

<p class="pcap">Woodcock</p>
</div>
<p>In spring the Woodcock must be sought in some bushy swale,
along the borders of a marsh, or near a small stream where the low
banks are constantly moist and where brush and old logs give this
retiring species a retreat. Here the nocturnal birds bore in the mud
with their long bills, searching for food which they may grasp with
the mobile tips of their mandibles. When disturbed they fly up
rapidly, their wings whistling musically as they make off, somewhat
erratically, through the undergrowth.</p>
<p>The spring courtship flight of the Woodcock is remarkable. On
warm evenings the males <i>bleat</i> in their favorite haunts, then, as
darkness descends, mount on whistling wings higher and higher,
until they are far above the earth. They then hurl themselves back
and forth as they start pitching toward the earth, the while producing
a twittering sound with their throats as they drop at considerable
speed, to alight not far from the point at which they
started. Courting Woodcocks will sometimes alight within a few
feet of a quiet observer.</p>
<p>Because the incubating bird is quiet and her back so perfectly
resembles the leaves and twigs near her, she is very difficult to see.
She so implicitly believes that she cannot be seen that she is not
often flushed from her nest; sometimes she will permit her back to
be stroked or her whole body to be lifted from her eggs.</p>

<p class="pcap">Wilson&rsquo;s Snipe</p>

<p>The average bird student knows the Snipe as a bird which
springs from a marshy spot with startled <i>scaip, scaip</i> as it zigzags
its way to a safe retreat, or mounts in the air to circle and return.
At such a time the reddish brown band at the tip of the tail and the
white belly, which flashes as the bird erratically turns, are good
field-marks.</p>
<p>On its nesting-grounds the Snipe is a different creature. High
overhead, in wide circles, the birds fly, giving forth strange windy
hoots which they are said to produce by spreading widely the
outermost feathers of the tail. When the performers come to earth
they may perch on a wayside post, on a fence, or on a tree&mdash;an
unheard-of feat for a Snipe at any other season. The male Snipe,
and perhaps the female also, performs many queer antics during
the nesting season.</p>
<p>The downy young, which leave their nests shortly after hatching,
are beautiful creatures&mdash;dark brown and black with cream-colored
and buffy spots and flecks which are arranged in a pattern which
gives them a protective coloration. They are strong-legged creatures
and can run rapidly and swim with ease as soon as they leave the
nest.</p>

<p class="pcap">Bartramian Sandpiper</p>
</div>
<p>The Upland Plover is a bird of wide pastures and grassy fields.
It is difficult to approach, save at the nesting season, when it may
come near so as to lead us away from its young; but its presence is
announced by the high and musical whistle which has given the
bird one of its popular names, &ldquo;Prairie Whistler,&rdquo; and which it
utters from the ground, while in flight, or while perched on a fencepost,
telegraph-pole, or tree.</p>
<p>The flight of this bird is singularly beautiful as, with wide wings
beating through a comparatively short arc, it fairly quivers through
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
the air. All its movements seem tremulous and graceful, and as it
alights it lifts its wings gracefully, high above its back, and folds
them carefully.</p>
<p>Its call-note, which is heard as the bird is disturbed, is a mellow,
bubbling whistle, very musical, and with a quality of liquidity which
few bird-notes possess.</p>
<p>The young birds run about shortly after hatching and are difficult
to find. They never go to the margins of streams to hunt their
food, as do other members of the family, and when autumn comes
they mount to the sky and make their way to the prairies of Texas
where they stop for a time while <i>en route</i> to their winter home in
Argentina.</p>
<p>If this magnificent bird is given careful protection, it may survive;
but unless it is guarded in South America, as well as in its nesting-grounds,
there is little hope for it.</p>

<p class="pcap">Spotted Sandpiper</p>
</div>
<p>The Spotted Sandpiper is our best-known shore-bird. It is not
particularly wary, and frequents all the small streams which have
not been polluted. As it runs along the muddy margin, it bobs and
teeters constantly, perhaps calling softly. Fluttering out over the
water, its wing-tips almost touching the surface, it whistles <i>tweet</i>,
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
<i>tweet, tweet, tweet</i>, clearly, and circles back to the shore or alights on a
stone or fallen tree. The white areas in the wings show rather plainly
in flight.</p>
<p>The young are so small and flimsy that they are comical, with
their wisps of tails and long, slender feet. They can swim readily,
however, and run with amazing rapidity. Even the adult can swim
and dive if necessary.</p>
<p>The Spotted Sandpiper is a much more energetic, nervous bird
than its relative, the Solitary Sandpiper, and it is not so often found
wading about in deep water as is that somewhat larger, darker bird.
When the two species fly up, the Solitary usually utters two or three
loud, sharp whistles as it flies directly away, or up into the air.
The Spotted, on the other hand, usually flutters away, just a little
above the water, and customarily circles back to the shore not far
away.</p>

<p>The Ring-neck is a native of Asia. It was brought to Great

acclimated there. In many parts of the New World, Ring-necks
have been introduced and they seem to make their way very

yet during the 1927 hunting season 177,500 of the birds were taken as

<p>In spite of its magnificent coloration, the Ring-neck is protectively
colored, though birds which wander about through the open field,
where they search for food, can be seen easily. As they fly up, it

<p class="pcap">Bob-White, Male</p>
</div>
<p>In winter Bob-Whites frequent old weed-patches,
briar-thickets, or cornfields where
the stalks have been left standing. They
are very sociable, and wander about in
flocks, searching for food, roosting together on the ground in a compact
ring, their heads out and tails together. Being protectively
colored, they usually do not fly until they are virtually tramped
upon. When a flock is disturbed, they rush into the air on noisy
wings and scatter in all directions. After a short time the birds
begin to call to each other, <i>pur-lee, pur-lee</i>, and the flock reassembles.</p>
<p>With the coming of spring the flocks break up. Male birds
mount favorite fence-posts, stones, or low boughs and give the clear
whistle which every farmer boy can imitate. This whistle is one of
the clearest and most powerful of bird-notes.</p>
<p>Male and female birds share the duties of incubating the eggs,
which are turned over carefully so that they get the proper amount
of heat. Sometimes the eggs are so numerous that they are piled
upon each other in the nest, and at such times the lower layer of
eggs must receive special attention. As a rule, all the eggs hatch.</p>
<p>Among the enemies of Bob-Whites are the blacksnake, which eats
the eggs and young; the Cooper&rsquo;s Hawk and the Goshawk, which
capture the adults; and the skunk and other ground-prowlers which
eat the eggs and sometimes the adults. Half-starved house cats are
frequently serious enemies of this popular game-bird.</p>

<p>The Ruffed Grouse, our best-known game-bird, is a creature of
personality. Protectively colored, he waits until he is almost trodden
upon, then rises with a startling whir of wings, leaving the wayfarer
thunderstruck. The female, as she incubates, is rarely seen,
for she does not stir, and her back perfectly imitates her surroundings.</p>
<p>In the spring, the male Grouse struts and drums at chosen spots
in the woodland. On a log he paces up and down, ruffs lifted, wide
tail fully spread and elevated; or he stands erect, and, beating his
chest rapidly with his wings, produces the drumming sound for
which he is so famous. Grouse may drum at any time of the year,
and sometimes at night, but they do so chiefly during the morning
on spring days.</p>
<p>The young run nimbly soon after hatching and leave their nest
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
at once. They develop rapidly. After a week they can fly readily
though they are very small. The mother Grouse, in luring an enemy
from her young, employs broken-wing tactics, dragging herself
over the ground as though she were badly wounded.</p>
<p>In the winter, Grouse develop long lateral scales on their toes
which function as snow-shoes. Their neat tracks in the snow lead
from a roost under a branch to which dead leaves cling, and wander
about the bushes and trees where the birds have been feeding on
buds, twigs, and dried berries. Grouse are especially fond of aspen,
birch, beech, and maple buds. They like wild-grape vines both for
the food and the shelter which they afford. During summer, Grouse
eat much insect food, as well as berries and leaves. They sometimes
eat hemlock needles and leaves of mountain laurel.</p>

<p>Having very keen senses, the Wild Turkeys are difficult to approach,
for they are very wary and at the slightest warning make
off on a run up the ridge, or leap into the air.</p>

grasshoppers, but in winter, when it is often necessary for them to
scratch in the snow, they eat chestnuts and acorns, the berries of

</div>
<p>At close range the Turkey Vulture is not a beautiful creature&mdash;its
carriage is slovenly, its facial expression unpleasant, and its
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
plumage harsh; but circling in the sky, its wide wings hardly moving
for hours at a time, it becomes a glorified being, among the most
graceful and well-balanced of our soaring birds.</p>
<p>It is equipped by Nature as a carrion-eater, the bare head and
neck permitting it to eat the flesh of dead animals without soiling
its feathers. Its feet are not used in capturing or carrying prey, but
a considerable burden may be carried in the bill. When Vultures
find a dead cow or horse, word seems to travel immediately to all
nearby districts and the great birds swing silently in to the feast.
They are frequently seen along roadsides where they devour rabbits
and other small mammals which have been killed by motor cars.</p>
<p>It is said that the Turkey Vulture carries the germs of hog
cholera and the dreaded foot-and-mouth disease. This is only
occasionally, if ever, true, however, and, as a rule, it is a harmless
and highly beneficial bird. Nevertheless, it is not protected in Pennsylvania
at the present time.</p>

<p>The Marsh Hawk is usually to be seen flying near the ground
over a field or low meadow. Beating its way along rapidly, it pauses
at times to watch the grass where prey may hide, sometimes wheeling
suddenly toward the ground as it captures a mouse or shrew. It
may always be recognized by the <i>white upper tail-coverts</i> which show
plainly in flight, a mark which our other hawks do not have.</p>
<p>Occasionally the Marsh Hawk circles high in air where the white
patch on the back is not visible. At such times the <i>long and somewhat
pointed wings</i>, black wing-tips, long tail, and white appearance
of the male and the dull brown appearance of the female will
distinguish the species.</p>
<p>The male has the interesting custom of looping the loop during
its season of courtship. At the nest the birds are very fierce in
defending their young and swoop about the intruder, uttering loud,
piercing, Flicker-like cries.</p>
<p>Its food consists of mice, frogs, snakes, and other creatures which
are captured among the cat-tails or on the ground. Occasionally it
takes a bird or visits the poultry-yard, but, as a rule, it is a beneficial
species. It is not protected in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The Sharp-shin is the enemy of all small birds. It is swift in
flight and skulks along among the bushes, pouncing upon its victims
suddenly. Near the nest of a pair

there were no small birds&mdash;they
had probably all been killed or
driven out by the Sharp-shins.</p>

<p>The Goshawk is our most savage destroyer

<p>In the field, it has a very gray appearance, more so than any other
species; even its heavily marked underparts, at a distance, are gray.
It does not often circle in the sky, preferring to fly at about the level
of tree tops, or, indeed, a few feet from the ground, so as to drop
upon unsuspecting prey.</p>
<p>The parent birds are formidable warriors when their nest is

<p>The Red-tail may easily be confused with the Red-shoulder,
which, while smaller, has the same proportions. The Red-shoulder
is more often found in swampy country or in the lowlands; the Red-tail
is a bird of the fields and open wood-lots. The Red-shoulder&rsquo;s
scream is clear and loud; that of the Red-tail is wheezy and often
whistle-like in quality. The Red-shoulder&rsquo;s flight is more rapid, at
times more owl-like than that of the Red-tail, and, of course, the
Red-shoulder&rsquo;s tail is never red-brown, but is black, crossed with
narrow white bands. Immature Red-shoulders are to be distinguished
from immature Red-tails with difficulty, partly because the
birds do not call much and partly because there is variation in the
size of the sexes&mdash;a small male Red-tail being not much larger than
a female Red-shoulder; in the hand, however, the young Red-shoulder
is more conspicuously <i>streaked</i> below than is the young
Red-tail, and the feet are <i>always</i> slenderer and more delicate than in
the larger species.</p>

adds materials to the last year&rsquo;s nest of a Crow and uses this structure
as a nest. <i>Eggs</i>: 3 to 6, pale greenish white, irregularly blotched with
dark reddish brown.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even at a distance the bright reddish coloration of the underparts
of the adult Red-shoulder should serve to distinguish it. The
bird student will do well to remember that the Red-shoulder and
Red-tail customarily choose prominent perches from which to watch
for prey, whereas the Cooper&rsquo;s Hawk, Sharp-shin, and Goshawk
almost never choose such lookout posts. A large Hawk seen on a
dead stub in the open is almost certainly either a Red-shoulder or a
Red-tail. The flying Red-shoulder circles more rapidly than does
the Red-tail, and with a glass the dark, white-barred tail should be
seen easily.</p>
<p>It is fond of snakes, frogs, and mice, which it captures usually in
the lowlands. Occasionally it catches a bird or young poultry, but
it visits the farms only when food is scarce in its wilder habitat.
Young Red-shoulders whose stomachs I examined at Pymatuning
Swamp had eaten only grasshoppers, field-mice, snakes, frogs, and
beetles.</p>
<p>The Red-shoulder&rsquo;s loud, clear scream, when familiar to the bird
student, is diagnostic. The Blue Jay can imitate this scream almost
perfectly, however, so the bird student must use care in recording
the species from call-note alone. This species, while for the most
part innocent in food habits, is not protected in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The Golden Eagle is occasionally caught in steel traps which have
been set for foxes or other fur-bearers. Each winter one or two of
these great birds are thus made captive or shot by farmers who are
protecting their poultry.</p>
<p>It is a magnificent creature, with its regal bearing, its deep set,
brilliant eyes, and its sleek, lustrous plumage. In captivity it is not
given to beating itself about, but bears itself with simple dignity,
as though it understood the futility of trying to make an escape.</p>
<p>In the field, it is to be distinguished with difficulty from the immature
Bald Eagle, the latter bird having white areas on the under
wing which the Golden Eagle lacks. Close at hand, it will be noted
that both birds have long feathers on the tibial region, the tips of
these feathers sometimes reaching well toward the toes, but in the
Golden Eagle the whole foot, down to the toes, is covered with
short, thick plumage.</p>
<p>The Golden Eagle has been known to kill foxes and lambs.
There is an authentic record of the killing of a sturdy, though small,
fawn by one of these great birds. Pursuing the fawn through the
woods, it frightened it over a sharp declivity, and its leg was broken
in the fall. The Eagle&rsquo;s long, vise-like talons and great bill finished
the unfortunate creature.</p>

<p class="pcap">Bald Eagle, Adult</p>
</div>
<p>The Bald Eagle is usually seen along
waterways or in the mountains. It
ranges widely and flies with great majesty, its wide, heavy wings
giving it, even at great distance, the appearance of weight and
strength.</p>
<p>It is fond of carrion and pursues the smaller Osprey or Fish Hawk
until that bird is forced to give up the prey which it has captured.
Bald Eagles rarely take poultry. They sometimes pursue water-fowl,
but in Pennsylvania do not destroy much game or valuable
wild-life and are therefore protected.</p>
<p>The cry of the Bald Eagle is a barking squeal, sometimes very
high and thin, often scarcely to be heard.</p>
<p>A dark-colored Eagle with white patches showing on the under-wing
is likely to be an immature Bald Eagle. The Golden Eagle almost
always appears dark from below, save for the basal half of the
tail, which is grayish or white.</p>

<p class="pcap">Duck Hawk, Adult</p>
</div>
<p>This is one of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s
rarest hawks. Along the Juniata
River, and where there are cliffs along
the Delaware and Susquehanna rivers, they are sometimes seen
beating their way buoyantly, high in the air, or plunging down from
the heights either in pursuit of prey or in play. Their call-note, a
sharp and rapidly repeated <i>kee, kee, kee, kee</i> echoes among the rocks.
Near their nest the birds are vicious toward intruders.</p>
<p>For speed and daring, the Duck Hawk is famous. It pursues
and captures the most rapid ducks, even Teal. I have seen it kill
Pileated Woodpeckers and Crows, but, as a rule, it captures Meadowlarks,
Blue Jays, Robins, and shorebirds which happen to pass by
its eyrie, or for which it watches from its high vantage-point. It is
particularly fond of domestic pigeons if there be any in the vicinity,
and will live almost exclusively upon them as long as the supply
lasts. Striking its prey with closed fists, it slashes the skin open with
the long claws of the hind toe.</p>
<p>Sometimes a Duck Hawk may be seen from the train window in
the vicinity of Huntingdon, Spruce Creek, Palmerton, or Dauphin.

<p>So many hawks are called Pigeon
Hawk that it is difficult to make Pennsylvania
farmers and gunners realize
that this little hawk is really a comparatively
rare bird. It flies rapidly, directly,

a Sparrow Hawk with a blue-gray back.</p>

<p class="pcap">Osprey</p>
</div>
<p>The Osprey is usually seen near a lake or waterway. Its easy
flight gives it somewhat the bearing of a gull, but its broad, barred
tail and dark upperparts distinguish it even at a great distance.</p>
<p>The Osprey&rsquo;s food is almost altogether fish. Its firm, glossy
plumage, its great claws, its slender, long wings, are all adapted to
the capture of fish, upon which it pounces from the air, plunging into
the water, sometimes to be lost to view for a second or more. Occasionally
it grips a fish so large that it cannot extricate its talons,
and is dragged to an unfortunate death. When the Osprey rises
from a plunge in the water it often halts in mid-air to shake itself
free of water, a somewhat amusing performance.</p>
<p>Although the Osprey eats fish almost exclusively, it is protected
in Pennsylvania. It sometimes captures the destructive carp which
is such a pest in some localities. It does not often take trout or
other valuable food or game-fish and never captures birds or game.
Smaller birds, such as grackles, fear the Osprey so little that they
have been known to build their own cradles among the foundation
material of the Osprey&rsquo;s bulky eyrie. Along the Atlantic Coast
Ospreys sometimes nest on the ground.</p>

<p class="pcap">Barn Owl</p>
</div>
<p>When a country newspaper announces
the capture of a creature, half monkey and
half bird, the bird student may be fairly certain that someone has
found a Barn Owl. The strange, melancholy expression of the bird&rsquo;s
face, its peculiarly awkward, long legs, and its odd habit of bowing,
hissing, and swaying back and forth, all make it an object of great
curiosity.</p>
<p>The Barn Owl can see perfectly by day, though it is chiefly
nocturnal. It preys upon rats, mice, and shrews principally, and is
almost altogether beneficial in its food-habits. All Owls have the
habit of throwing up wads of indigestible matter, such as the bones
and fur of the mice they have eaten. An examination of the pellets
of the Barn Owl has shown that these creatures eat but very few
birds and virtually no game.</p>
<p>Half-grown young in their nest, clamoring for food, make a considerable
outcry. They have insatiable appetites and during early
summer the parents are kept busy bringing in rats and mice for their
hungry offspring.</p>
<p>The Barn Owl&rsquo;s golden brown and gray back, its white appearance
beneath, and its <i>lack of any ear-tufts</i> are good field-marks. This
species is protected in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p class="pcap">Long-eared and Short-eared Owls</p>
</div>
<p>Long-eared Owls are neither noisy nor bold, and may therefore
live in a region without being known unless the bird student assiduously
searches for them in dense hemlock clumps, in cedars, or
thick grape-vine tangles, where they are usually to be found. They
are principally nocturnal, and it is sometimes difficult to make the
birds fly from their perches during the day. Any medium-sized owl
which flies from a dense hemlock is likely to be of this species. Its
general appearance, at such a time, is grayish.</p>
<p>It is a highly beneficial bird, living almost altogether on mice
which it captures both in the woodlands and at the edges of fields.
These it swallows wherever it may be, but the pellets are usually
cast up during the daytime at the favorite resting-place, so after a
few months&rsquo; sojourn at one point the pellets become numerous.
Pellets of this nature, strewn over the ground, are always a fairly
sure sign of the presence of owls.</p>
<p>The young, which resemble their parents in color, are remarkably
adept at clambering about their nesting-tree before they can fly.
They are odd in appearance when newly hatched, with their queer
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
eyes and large mouths. Since the eggs are laid and hatch at intervals
of two or three days each, the young are of different sizes.</p>
<p>The call-note of this Owl, which I have not frequently heard,
resembles a Screech Owl&rsquo;s quavering whistle somewhat, but is
shorter, more whining, and less musical, and is varied with angry,
coughing sounds. This species is protected in Pennsylvania.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The Short-eared Owl sometimes hunts during the day. It courses
over the meadows and marshes, its wide, soft wings carrying it
easily but rather unsteadily, a few feet from the ground. As a rule,
it prefers to hunt at eventide.</p>
<p>It nearly always perches on the ground. Its coloration is protective
as it sits among the dead grasses or cat-tail leaves, motionless
until it springs awkwardly into the air and makes off. It does
not often alight in trees, though it may occasionally roost in low,
dense bushes or conifers.</p>
<p>As the Short-ear flies away, the light spots on the upper surfaces
of the wing and the dark spots at the bend of the wing on the under
surface are usually noticeable. Any medium-sized owl which flies
up from the ground in the open is almost certain to be of this species.</p>
<p>Its food habits are strictly beneficial. It captures mice, preferring
to hunt in the open, almost never capturing its prey in the woodlands.
It is often found in large flocks during the period of migration.
In fact, where one occurs others are likely to be found. Flocks
sometimes number a hundred or more individuals. When these
owls visit a farm in such numbers for a week or two, they may
effectively destroy the mice and other destructive small mammals.</p>
<p>The Short-eared Owl is curious; squeaking cries, given in imitation
of a mouse or small bird, will sometimes cause it to come
very close, where it may hover for several seconds, if the observer
remains perfectly motionless. The Short-eared Owl is protected in
Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>I shall never forget my first glimpse of
a Barred Owl. In a deep woodland, where
all was quiet and where shadows lent an
air of mystery, I suddenly realized that
a shapeless ball of brown on a nearby
branch was <i>three</i> young Barred Owls, sitting very close together,
eyes nearly shut. As I approached they refused to budge, preferring,
it appeared, to keep their eyes closed so as not to be bothered
with any unpleasant consideration of an encounter with an enemy.
When I rapped the branch upon which they sat, they opened their
eyes, popped their beaks, and flew off grunting. Their mother
swooped down upon me with an angry cry.</p>
<p>The Barred Owl&rsquo;s song is weird. It is a series of eight or nine
hoots which are given with much vigor, and which, at a distance,
sound like the barking of a dog. When two or three Barred Owls
join in a chorus, the effect is unbelievably comical. The usual cry is
often varied with single hoots, barks, or grunts.</p>
<p>It is not blameless in food habits. The usual fare of mice and
chipmunks is occasionally varied with squirrels, rabbits, and birds,
usually of smaller varieties.</p>
<p>A good imitation of the cries of a Barred Owl may draw the
creatures close, sometimes many of them at once. This cry will
sometimes attract Crows also, who sense the possibility of a good
hour&rsquo;s attack upon an ancient foe.</p>

<p class="pcap">Great Horned Owl</p>
</div>
<p>The Great Horned Owl is so muscular
and so well armed with heavy
beak and iron talons that it does not
hesitate to capture large prey, such as large chickens, geese, and even
turkeys. It is very fond of cotton-tail rabbits, whose skulls it crushes
with a nip of its beak, and often kills skunks, though it may carry
a reminder of the encounter for months. It is one of our most destructive
birds of prey, though it varies its diet with mice and
other harmful creatures.</p>
<p>The deep-voiced hoot of this owl is usually heard on early spring
nights. A mellow, bass <i>who, who-who-who, who, who</i>, with remarkable
carrying power, is the love-song. It is sometimes given all night
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
long during late January, when the moonlight gives the woodlands a
chilly and mysterious brilliance. A loud and startling scream is
sometimes given, which is often wrongly attributed to a wild cat.
The probability is that a wild cat in its wildest fit of anger or alarm
could not produce a sound half so loud and terrifying.</p>
<p>In captivity the Great Horned Owl rarely becomes tame, though
it may stand on its perch quietly enough during the day. One
which I had at one time was somewhat tractable, yet not to be
trusted. It caught the fingers of my left hand one day with its
great claws. Being unable to extricate myself, and being threatened
at any minute with a nip from the vicious beak, I summoned aid.
I learned a little that day about the terrific grip that closes upon the
unfortunate rabbit or skunk this creature captures.</p>

<p>The Snowy Owl is a bird of the open fields, not of the woodlands,
and, like the Rough-legged Hawk, is likely to be seen perched on a
fence-post, a hay-stack, or on the ground, rather than in a tree.
Its white plumage makes it a prominent feature of the landscape
save when there is snow on the ground.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, its food includes small game animals and birds,
mice, and other small mammals, and, occasionally, poultry. It is
not particularly harmful, since it usually confines its hunting to the
open fields. In the North Country it preys upon water-fowl. Its
flight is very strong and rapid. It is not protected in Pennsylvania,
though it should be because of its great rarity.</p>

<p>The flashing white collar and underparts of the Kingfisher gleam
as he flies rapidly along his chosen stream, giving his loud, rattling
call. As he perches on a favorite overhanging stub, he elevates his
crest, rattles once or twice, then becomes quiet as he watches the
pool below him. Suddenly he dives from his perch, there is a splash,
and he disappears beneath the surface. In a few seconds he arises,
a slim, glistening fish in his mandibles. He makes off up stream,
rattling again and again as the fish ceases its struggles, then swallows
his prey, head first, entire. In addition to fish, he eats crayfish and
other small aquatic creatures, and sometimes mice.</p>
<p>When the young hatch they are naked and ugly. They soon are
covered with pin-feathers, however, and when the tips of these
break, the young begin to look like their parents at once. Several
days before they leave the burrow to learn angling for themselves,
they scuttle about on their short feet, sometimes coming to the
entrance for a moment to glimpse the world that is soon to be such
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
an unfolding of adventure for them. They rattle like their parents,
and if a hand is thrust in among them, they pick savagely at the

<p class="pcap">Yellow-bellied Sapsucker</p>
</div>
<p>The Sapsucker is, for the most part, a quiet and rather dignified
woodpecker. Rarely does it pound noisily at a dead stub, searching
for grubs. As a rule, it is to be seen drilling its sap-wells on the
lower trunk of a maple, apple, or hemlock, where it clings sometimes
for hours at a time if unmolested. These wells, which penetrate
only to the sap-bearing layer of bark, are made in regular rows.
Here gathers the sap which the bird regularly swallows, together
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
with all the small insects which have come to drink. This sap-drilling
is a destructive trait, for many valuable trees are girdled
annually through the attacks, chiefly, of the migrant birds. During
the summer the parents capture only insect food for their young.</p>
<p>The mewing note of the Sapsucker will startle the beginner in
bird-study. It is almost as convincing an imitation of the cry of a
cat as is the scolding, querulous call of a Catbird, and is a familiar
sound of the spring woods.</p>
<p>When courtship starts, Sapsuckers quite forget their dignity and
go flashing through the tree-tops, sometimes three or four in a flock,
bowing and dancing, displaying their spotted wings and tails and
giving forth loud and incessant Flicker-like cries of <i>plee-kah,
plee-kah</i>.</p>
<p>A Sapsucker sometimes actually becomes intoxicated with the
juice it has drunk and wanders through the woods bumping into
trees and branches, grasping the bark as best it can with toes which
are marvelously adapted to holding to rough surfaces, even while
the bird sleeps.</p>

into soft wood, the bird student receives a thrill few of our birds can

undulating than in other woodpeckers.</p>
<p>It is given to searching for food in deep, shadowy woods, where
it is sometimes the only bird to be found, and where the sound of its
hammering gives the only hint of life in the vast stillness.</p>
<p>The call of the Pileated is a high, irregular cackle, something like
the spring song of the Flicker, but more noisy and irregular. An
imitation of this cry, a clapping of the hands, or the beating of a
dead stub with a stick, will sometimes bring the curious, bright-eyed
creatures very close&mdash;too close, if the gunner be of the
law-breaking kind. The fact that this bird is sometimes called
Woodcock, and therefore regarded as a game-bird, has led to the
destruction of many of them. They are naturally creatures of the
wilderness, and have never been really common. Careful protection
will be necessary if we are to keep them from extinction in this

<p>The Flicker is very fond of ants. Patiently it will sit on an ant-hill,
probing its long, saliva-covered tongue down into the burrow,
drawing the insects out and eating them by the dozen. It may remain
thus at an ant-hill half an hour at a time, filling its gizzard
and crop with the insects, whose bites and acid flavor seem not to
be objectionable.</p>
<p>Flickers sometimes become annoying when they choose a tin roof
or favorite spot on a gable as a drumming-point. At such a place
they will roll out their challenge at sunrise on the spring mornings,
wakening all the household. Occasionally they drill their nests in
houses, under the eaves, and thereby may do considerable damage.</p>
<p>The courtship dance is animated and beautiful. With handsome
wings flashing and tail widely spread, the birds bow to each other,
calling rapidly <i>wickah, wickah, wickah</i>. Flickers are considerably
persecuted by Starlings which oust them from their nests and use
the cavities as their own.</p>

woods where, in a quiet tangle of ferns and bushes, a dark brown,
silent-winged creature may fly from the leaves, to flutter a few rods
farther on, and drop again to the ground. The well-known song
which is given with such constancy and fervor on spring and summer

<p>The Nighthawk is a familiar bird of summer evenings, when even
over the cities it circles back and forth, calling as it hunts its insect
food, <i>pee-ah, pee-ah</i>, in a rough, grating voice. In spring it courts
its mate by plunging rapidly downward on set wings, producing with
the vibrating primaries a booming sound which has given the bird
the nickname &ldquo;Bull-Bat.&rdquo; It is one of our most beneficial birds.
During the day it sleeps or rests on the ground, or sits lengthwise on
a horizontal branch. It has recently taken to laying its eggs on
gravel-roofed buildings in the city. Young Nighthawks, equipped
as they are with strong feet, can run nimbly. The parents, though
able to fly well, have lost much of the power of their foot-muscles

effect. As he flies, his wings beat rapidly with a fluttering motion,
and the white tip of his widely spread tail
shows plainly at considerable distance. His
challenge note, which may be written
<i>pi-tink, pi-tink</i>, irregularly repeated, is
the only outcry usually heard, though he
occasionally indulges in a softer effort
which may be called a song. If a small
pebble is tossed at him in play, he watches
it carefully in a curiously puzzled fashion,
as though he were at the point of capturing
and swallowing it. He has some
difficulty in tiring and capturing insects
as large as a dragon-fly, but he is very
fond of these strong-winged insects, and
pursues them assiduously. Rarely he captures
bees, and these are usually drones.</p>

<p>In the windy, open fields or on treeless hilltops, this demure and
dull-colored bird lives. As he walks or runs among the short grass,
twittering in a companionable way, standing still for a moment to
survey his surroundings, then wandering off again, little is noted to
remind us of the glorious courtship song which this bird of the
ground gives during early spring, and for which he should be as
famous as the English Skylark. Mounting upward from the clods,
he finally reaches a far height, where he pours out his melodious,
tinkling music, minute after minute, sweeping about in wide circles,
or steadily flying into the wind. Thirty or forty times he may give
his song, then becoming tired of his performance, downward he
drops to the earth in long, graceful sweeps to alight unconcernedly.
He sometimes sings from the ground or from a fence-post.</p>
<p>Horned Larks are given to flocking together in the winter, and
when snow covers the ground they sometimes come into the farmyards,
or congregate along roads, where they eat horse-manure or
waste grain. Look for the black facial markings of these plain brown
birds, and remember that they will be found <i>only in open country</i>.</p>

<br /><span class="h3l2"><i>Cyanocitta cristata bromia</i> Oberholser</span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="sc">Description.</span>&mdash;Larger than Robin; sexes similar, both with prominent
crest; nostril covered with tuft of feathers. Head, crest, and back grayish

<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
white, darkest on sides; wings and tail bright turquoise-blue, the greater
coverts, secondaries, and tertials tipped broadly with white, and all of the
feathers barred strikingly with black on their exposed surface; tail-feathers
barred with black, the outer ones tipped noticeably with white; feet and
bill black; eyes dark brown. <i>Length</i>: About 12 inches.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Range in Pennsylvania.</span>&mdash;We should expect the Blue Jay to be a
permanent resident in Pennsylvania wherever it is found. It occurs the year
round, notably in the southwestern and southern
counties, and is usually a summer resident and
early spring and mid-fall migrant from March
20 to November 1; as a summer bird it is somewhat
local in distribution.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Nest.</span>&mdash;A bulky mass of twigs, rootlets, and
weed-stalks, rather well made and neatly cupped,
placed from 10 to 30 feet from the ground, usually
in a more or less open situation and often in
a conifer. <i>Eggs</i>: 3 to 6, pale gray green or greenish
gray, heavily marked with dull and indefinite
brown and gray spots.</p>

<p class="pcap">Blue Jay</p>
</div>
<p>The Blue Jay&rsquo;s colors and manners are
unmistakable. As he flies, the white-tipped
outer tail-feathers and secondaries show
plainly; as he perches, his crest is prominent.
But when the bird student essays to
identify the Blue Jay from call-notes alone
there may be trouble, for this bright creature not only has a considerable
vocabulary of his own but also imitates other birds extremely
well. He can reproduce the scream of a Red-shouldered Hawk so
faithfully that small birds of the vicinity drop into silence for an
instant. More than once this cry has misled me. As a rule, he
screams <i>peer, peer</i> in a dominant, harsh voice, or gives violin-like,
squeaky calls, the pattern and musical intent of which are known
only to himself.</p>
<p>He is a confirmed nest-robber and is not protected by law in
Pennsylvania. While it is true that he eats the eggs and young of
smaller birds, yet he has some food habits in his favor, and at worst
is a handsome villain.</p>
<p>The nest is defended valiantly by the parents. I once climbed to
a Blue Jay&rsquo;s nest and took the last remaining young one. As I
started to descend I felt a sharp blow on my forehead. When I
reached the ground my face was lined with blood; the parent bird
had punctured my skin with her beak.</p>
<p>In fall and winter, Blue Jays are very fond of beechnuts and
acorns. At the feeding-counter they often choose peanuts if these
are to be found. Their hearty manner and brilliant colors make
them an attractive addition to any flock of bird-neighbors, in spite
of their objectionable traits.</p>

Crows, were not their cracked, raucous

the gorges which they inhabit. Looking
up we may see the great black
birds <i>circling</i> through the sky like
hawks; we may be near enough to
note that the tail is not rounded as in
the Crow, but wedge-shaped, the
middle feathers being noticeably the longest. When a Raven does
not soar, nor croak, he appears much like a Crow, and identification
ought to be either from notes, or flight, or from direct comparison
with Crows. These smaller cousins, incidentally, mob the Raven
with as much gusto as they exhibit in attacking an owl.</p>

<p class="pcap">Starling, in Spring</p>
</div>
<p>Introduced from Europe about fifty years ago, the Starling has
extended its range rapidly, so that it is today one of the abundant
birds of most of Pennsylvania. It is very gregarious and, save in
the spring, is usually seen in immense flocks, walking through fields
or wheeling about in the air, with fluttering flight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>It nests early, utilizing all available cavities, and if there are
not enough to go round, it permits Flickers or Red-headed Woodpeckers
to dig one and then ousts the owners so as to use the new
cavity for its own nest. It has been known actually to kill
Flickers in driving them from their newly made nests. As Starlings
become increasingly abundant, there is grave danger of their making
it difficult for some of our birds to rear their young at all.</p>
<p>The Starling is a great mimic. It has a characteristic, high, thin
squeal and numerous chuckling notes, which it intersperses with
imitations of the Wood Pewee, Bob-White, and other well-known
birds. As it sings, it puffs out its throat-feathers, and during
spring, shakes its wings in ecstasy.</p>
<p>Favorable remarks must be made concerning the food-habits of
this bird. It eats, especially during spring and summer, much
noxious insect life, noticeably larv&aelig; which it finds in lawns and
fields, and it preys upon the dreaded Japanese beetle. As its natural
enemies come to assert themselves, it may eventually become a
desirable bird citizen.</p>
<p>Starlings roost together in great numbers. They like to congregate
in barn-lofts, cupolas or steeples, or along the high window-sills
and cornices of buildings where they squeal all night as they
crowd each other, or take short flights in the soft glow of the electric
lights.</p>

<p>Robert o&rsquo;Lincoln is not to be found in every meadow where
daisies grow, and where the grass is deep and green, but in those
wide, green lowlands or grassy slopes which he has chosen for his
own, the gay songster reigns supreme, flying on tremulous wings
over the flowers, trailing into the grasses to let his legs and wings
hang limp while he continues his bubbling song, flying boldly toward
the intruder and luring him aside. The Bobolink&rsquo;s song is a marvel
of bird-music. It seems to spring from an inexhaustible supply of
strange syllables and genuine musical notes, offered in a tumultuous
jumble as profligate as the manner in which the bird lets himself
fall into the grass while he continues to sing. Sometimes I have
thought the birds wanted to stop their song but could not. And,
meanwhile, the female is warned of the approach of an enemy; she
sits quietly on her nest, or slips away.</p>
<p>In the autumn, the birds abandon their nesting-grounds and
flock in the grain-fields, garden-patches, or swamp-lands where
goldenrod and rank weeds furnish food and shelter for the night.
Here the yellowish young troop along, gaily calling <i>wink, wink</i> as
the weed-tops bend with the weight of their plump bodies. On a
cool night they rise to pass to the rice-fields of the South, where
they will be shot by the thousand as the dreaded Ricebird, and
thence to South America, their winter home.</p>

rest of plumage black, with greenish reflections over most of the surface, but
bluish and purplish in certain lights. <i>Adult female</i>: Noticeably smaller than

<p><span class="sc">Range in Pennsylvania.</span>&mdash;An abundant summer resident from about
March 15 to November 1; casual in winter.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Nest.</span>&mdash;The Cowbird builds no nest but lays its eggs in the nests of
other, usually smaller, species, and does not incubate them nor care for the
young in any way. The species most commonly thus parasitized in Pennsylvania
are the Red-eyed Vireo, Yellow Warbler, Ph&oelig;be, Song and Field
Sparrow, Ovenbird, Scarlet Tanager, and others. I have never found Cow-bird
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
eggs in a Red-winged Blackbird&rsquo;s nest, and, as a rule, Red-wings chase
Cowbirds away from their home swamp angrily whenever they appear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the Cowbird comes in spring he is usually concerned over
his mating, and while he is not a songster, he puts much energy
into his high, thin squeak as he bows, almost upside down, with
wings and tail outspread, in the top of some tree. This same high
note is often to be heard as the birds, in groups of three or four,
pass over, undulating slightly in the manner of their tribe.</p>
<p>On the ground, the Cowbird walks in a quiet and dignified manner.
It may be seen in pastures, sometimes perching on the cows&rsquo; backs
where it captures insects. I once saw a
flock of them remain an entire morning
near a newly born calf, evincing great interest
in the little creature and its mother.</p>
<p>The female is an expert at locating nests.
Evidently she watches smaller birds, learns
where they are building their nests, and
then while they are not watching her, slips
in and deposits her egg. Sometimes the
egg is laid long before the nest is completed.
Occasionally, when an egg is thus deposited
before the rightful owner of the
nest has laid her eggs, the little birds build
another bottom in their nest, sealing the
heavy egg beneath the hair and vegetable
fiber. Yellow Warbler nests are thus
sometimes several stories high, and I have more than once found
eggs sealed into the foundation material of the nests of larger birds.
I remember one Scarlet Tanager nest which held two eggs of the
owner and four of the Cowbird, and there was an additional Cowbird
egg sealed in the foundation material.</p>

no ill effects seem to result from this parasitism upon smaller birds.</p>

<p>At about the time the hilarious tree-frogs
set up their evening choruses, the Red-wing returns. His
handsome plumage enlivens the stretches of dead cat-tails, and his
tuneful, liquid song delights the ear. As he sings, he spreads his
blazing wing-patches and fluffs out his glossy plumage. The males
come north in a body before the females arrive.</p>
<p>The females set to work building the nests almost at once. If the
weed-growth is low in the swamp, they build them but slightly
above the water; those built by females which arrive later are
higher. If nests are suspended upon growing cat-tail leaves or
stalks, they are sometimes overturned by the unequal growth of

<p>The high, clear whistle of the Meadowlark, as he perches in a tree
or stands erect on the ground, is a familiar bird-song of the early
spring. His bright breast glows in the sunshine as he stands for an
instant, then disappears altogether as he lowers his head and walks
through the grass. Let him slip out of sight for a second, and it
may be difficult to see him again, for he is protectively colored, the
margins of the feathers of his back forming lines which resemble
the dead grasses. As he flies, his wings beat in a muscular fashion
and the white outer feathers of his short, widespread tail show
plainly. If his nest is nearby, he may perch on a post and call with
a rough chattering as he flashes his tail energetically.</p>
<p>The Meadowlark&rsquo;s food habits are chiefly beneficial. It eats
many grubs and cutworms, confining most of its foraging to the
ground.</p>
<p>In the early fall, they sometimes congregate in great flocks,

<p>The male Oriole is one of our most gorgeous birds, with his bright
colors and loud, assertive song. In the full-flowered apple trees, the
dignified creature crawls about, nipping at buds or snatching up
insects. The female builds the nest, and the young call for food

incessantly, often attracting attention to it. Some of the Oriole&rsquo;s

<p>This is our <i>blackest</i> Blackbird in the spring; in the fall it is hardly
a black bird at all. Look for this species in swampy situations or
along the margins of streams. It likes to walk about on the ground
and <i>through water</i> like a sandpiper, and is more terrestrial than the
Red-wing. The spring flocks sometimes burst forth into song, and
the effect at a distance is that of sleigh-bells&mdash;a jangling, jolly
chorus. A single male&rsquo;s efforts hardly merit being called a song.
Rusty Blackbirds are grackle-like in actions, and their whitish

its bill is frequently covered with resinous substances. In Pennsylvania

similar plants. It is sometimes quite unsuspicious, being unacquainted

<p>The lovely Purple Finch is all too little known. It occurs at some
time during the year at every locality in Pennsylvania, yet it is not a
familiar bird. The song alone should win it wide acclaim as a bird-neighbor,
for, delivered from the top of a tree, or from a vine or
weed, it is one of the brightest, most varied of our bird melodies and
is given with such enthusiasm that we recognize in the singer a
canary-like interest in prolonging the performance.</p>
<p>Purple Finches are often seen among the budding branches of a
fruit tree, balancing on the slender twigs as they eat buds and
capture occasional insects. The females are virtually silent, until
they have cause to depart, then they swing off into the air, bound
merrily higher and higher above the tree-tops, and make off as they
call <i>tik, tik</i> in a characteristic tone. This important call-note should
be remembered; it often serves to identify the species when the
colors cannot be seen.</p>
<p>In its nesting-range, the song of this Finch is to be heard during
all the spring and early summer days. At Pymatuning Swamp,
restless males sang almost constantly while their mates assembled
nesting materials. An ecstatic flight-song is frequently given when
the bright male flutters high into the air and, still singing, descends
on trembling wings to the twigs and new leaves.</p>
<p>The Purple Finch&rsquo;s habit of eating buds and flowers of trees,
including valuable orchard varieties, causes it to be unpopular
when it is too common.</p>

<p>The Goldfinch is comparatively unknown
as a winter bird. With the change
of color the birds become wilder in disposition,
no longer frequent the lawns
and roadsides, and band together in large flocks. In summer the
brightly colored males are very noticeable as they swing about
among the flowers in a field or perch on dandelions in the yard.
They are brilliant singers, even in winter, and may be recognized

of the deeply undulating flight.</p>
<p>This bird nests very late, eggs being laid in latter June and July.
In spring they are sometimes considerably mottled in appearance,
as the brown winter plumage drops out and is replaced by the yellow
of summer. This prenuptial moult is usually complete by the
middle of May, or earlier, and with the brighter plumage return
all the familiar call-notes and graceful motions which we associate
with these attractive birds.</p>

<p>Look for the Savannah Sparrow in spring and summer only in
wide, open fields where the grass is short. Here a slight, buzzing,
trilling song may be heard from a sparrow which is <i>prominently
streaked below</i>, and which has much the appearance of a Song Sparrow,
but does not bob its tail as it flies, nor seek cover in bushes.
If the bird student will remember that this species is to be found
only in wide fields, usually when there are no bushes, and that there
are no prominently white outer tail-feathers, as in the Vesper
Sparrow, he may find this little-known bird fairly common in his
region. In fall it is found in weed-patches along roads or in bushy
fields. (See illustration, <a href="#Page_109">page 109</a>.)</p>

<p>Here is a bird which will more than likely pass unnoticed unless
the fine, insect-like song is heard. Some bird students never realize
that this species nests in their region, for they never hear this song,
and they have not the patience to trail about
after every little brown bird they see. The
Grasshopper Sparrow&rsquo;s song is dry, unmusical,
and buzzing, and it seems a fitting
accompaniment to hot midsummer
fields which are covered with dust and upgrown
with coarse weeds. The bird is almost
never seen, save while it is singing
from the top of a weed or from a fence-post.
On the ground it disappears almost
at once, for its colors are highly protective.
The flight is fluttering and somewhat erratic.
If the bird flushes from the grass, it
usually does not alight near at hand, but
zigzags to a far corner of the field and drops
into the grass.</p>

<p>The large size and noticeable markings of this sparrow make it
comparatively easy to identify. It is not often so common as its
near and similar relative, the White-throated Sparrow, from which
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
it differs in having no yellow before the eye or on the bend of the
wing, and <i>no white throat-patch</i>. The song of the White-crowned
Sparrow is composed of soft, rich whistles
which have a plaintive character, similar
to that of the well-known White-throat&rsquo;s
<i>peabody</i> song, with an additional rough
undertone between the first and latter
parts of the song. The White-crown, while
in Pennsylvania, nearly always occurs in
flocks, usually in the woodlands, in brush-piles,
or along hedges. <i>Remember that a bird
with a white crown need not necessarily be this
species</i>, for the White-throat also has such
a crown; but the plain gray throat of the
White-crown is usually easy to detect in the
field, since the birds are not wild. All members
of the sparrow tribe are seed eaters.</p>

<p>The Tree Sparrow is a bird of weedy fields and hedges. In flocks
they search for seeds which have fallen upon the snow. When the
winter sun shines they call in companionable
and softly musical notes. In spring the Tree
Sparrow has a gay, somewhat warbler-like song,
which I believe is not very well known among
our bird students. The Tree, Field, and Chipping
Sparrows are similar in appearance. Identification
of these birds should not be difficult,
however, if one remembers that the Tree
Sparrow is a <i>winter</i> bird, while the Field and
Chipping Sparrows usually arrive in spring
after the Tree Sparrows have returned north.
If by some chance the three sparrows do occur
together, remember the black spot in the
breast of the Tree Sparrow and the yellowish bill, field-marks which
the other two species do not have.</p>

<p>The clear, whistled trill of the Field Sparrow is a welcome promise
of spring, as the bird, just returned from the south, sings in the brown
fields. This song is often but a simple repetition of the same note,
becoming more rapid toward the end and running into a sort of trill.</p>
<p>This bird is rather shy, and in flying away gives us a rather
unsatisfactory glimpse of fairly long tail and grayish rump. If we

smaller Junco.</p>
<p>Listen for the often-repeated, rather loud call-note of this bird,

rather musical and resembles somewhat the following syllabization

rapidly as to be scarcely pronounceable. The Towhee sings from
the top of a bush or low tree and, while performing, lets his tail
hang limp and lifts and throws back his head.</p>
<p>Young Towhees, carefully guarded by their voluble and agitated

the singer carefully or he will fly before you get a good glimpse of him.
The female is not easy to recognize unless she happens to be with

<p>Spluttering notes, some of which resemble an old-fashioned
music-box, announce the return of the Martins to their accustomed
nesting quarters. Gracefully, the glossy birds sail about, calling to
each other, capturing insects, and perching near or upon their nest.
They have almost altogether given up nesting in hollow trees and
prefer to use bird-boxes, it appears, though in such towns as Waynesburg,
Ligonier, and Coudersport they nest in any cranny among
the buildings which they can find. Martins are very fond of dragonflies;
they have the interesting habit of bringing green leaves into the
nest during summer, either as new lining for the nests, to make the
young birds cooler, or for some other reason. In late summer they
band together, sometimes in tremendous flocks, depart for some
congregating point along the New Jersey or Delaware coast, or
elsewhere, and prepare for the journey to their South American
winter home. Purple Martins are temperamental in choosing their
nesting quarters. Certain towns do not please them, and they will
not, apparently, nest; in other towns they nest anywhere.</p>

<p>Look for the buffy rump-patch of this slow-flying, graceful
swallow, which gathers mud for its nest without alighting on the
ground and whose conversational twitterings sound like the squeaks
produced by rubbing a piece of wet rubber with the finger. In
early spring and during later summer, several kinds of swallows
will be found together in the migratory flocks. Cliff Swallows are
easily driven from their nests by English Sparrows or Starlings; they
will not use bird-boxes put out for them.</p>

<p>Every farmer boy loves the cheerful swallows which twitter so
amiably and circle so tirelessly about the barn, capturing insects
above nearby pools and darting through the doors, or sometimes
through mere cracks in the boards, so unerringly. These birds have
good reason to be popular, for they are not only beautiful and
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
companionable neighbors, but they are distinctly beneficial because
of their capturing of myriads of flying insects which they eat or feed
to their ravenous young. I once saw a blacksnake at the nest of a
Barn Swallow, high on an upper rafter in a barn-loft, and it had
eaten two of the young before I interrupted its meal.</p>

<p>The Cedar Waxwing&rsquo;s trim form and sleek plumage make him an
outstandingly handsome bird. He has no song, however, giving
forth only a fine, shrill <i>eeeeeeee</i>, which is scarcely audible to some
observers. A flock of these plump-bodied birds sometimes sit in a
tree-top, their feathers fluffed out. They catch insects like flycatchers.
Sometimes they indulge in a queer little dance. In a
cherry tree which is full of fruit, they sometimes pass tid-bits between
them in a strangely deliberate, polite fashion. They are very
fond of cedar berries, poke berries, and the fruits of the Virginia
creeper, but the name &ldquo;Cherry Bird&rdquo; is well earned. Remember
the crest, the upright carriage, the flocking tendency, and the
<i>yellow-tipped tail</i> of this species. The waxwings are the only birds
which have their tails tipped with yellow.</p>
<p>The <b>Northern</b> or <b>Bohemian Waxwing</b> (<i>Bombycilla garrula</i>) is to
be found rarely in winter. Records of this species in Pennsylvania

larger; the under tail-coverts are rich reddish brown, and the wings
are marked with a white patch on the primary coverts, white
tips on the secondaries, and white and yellow edgings on the primaries.
When Bohemian Waxwings appear they are likely to be docile
and unsuspicious, and will therefore give the observer an excellent
opportunity to identify them satisfactorily.</p>

<p>This warbler is so common that it should be
known by all. Look for it along up-grown streams
where weeds are thick and deep, or along the
margins of marshes. The song has been written <i>witchity, witchity,
witchity</i>, but this is sometimes varied considerably. The call-note is
a harsh, rather loud tschack. The facial mask of the male is to be
confused with no bird other than the rather rare Kentucky Warbler
which is to be found <i>on wooded hillsides</i>, not in deep weeds along
streams and pools. The Yellow-throat gives a flight-song, and also
has a Red Squirrel-like, long-drawn-out series of chips, not often
heard. If you make it a point to visit a marshy spot in late summer
or early fall, you will almost certainly see these birds in the deep
weeds, sedges, or cat-tails.</p>

<p>The Chat has his own ideas about singing.
He fluffs out his feathers, mounts a tree
above the brush-covered hillside where his
nest is hidden, and begins an odd performance.
He clucks, he squeals, then repeats
several times a loud, deep whistle. Perhaps,
in his enthusiasm, he flies upward, to somersault
back to the leaves in reckless fashion. He spreads the feathers
of his dandelion-yellow throat and twirls his head as he sings. It
seems that surely he will lose some of his feathers while he flops
about.</p>

<p>You cannot intrude upon his concert. He hears the snap of a
twig, the song ceases, and perhaps you will catch only a glimpse of
the olive-green back.</p>

very poorly hidden, and may be found by looking through the

<p>The flashing white inner webs of the
outer tail-feathers of this species are an
excellent field-mark. Wherever the bird
is found, it is easily observed, though it is
very active. Its song I have written as
<i>too-wit, too-wit, too-wee-oh</i>, given in a
sprightly manner. Look for it in luxuriant,
young tree-growth on partially
shaded hillsides. In the fall Hooded
Warblers may be silent, but they usually
flash their tails as they become excited
over our presence. The somewhat similarly
colored Wilson&rsquo;s Warbler has no
black on the throat.</p>

<p>Here is a bird well worth finding. It is common and confiding,
but its gorgeous plumage never fails to produce a gasp of amazement.
As though the Redstart felt the need of making the most of
his beautiful attire, he spreads his wings and tail, flashing them as
he bustles about the twigs, fans them widely as he tumbles after an
insect, and pauses in the sunshine a moment between his foraging
expeditions. Even the female spreads her yellow-marked wings.</p>
<p>The song is not musical; it is wheezy and wiry, and not easily

to bound away, uttering its simple

<p>The Mocker&rsquo;s song is world-famous. It

flashing wings and tail. He sometimes sings
for hours at night. While rare in Pennsylvania,
he seems to be extending his range gradually northward.</p>

varied and pleasing in spots, is interspersed with
squeaks and chuckles which are not musical. As
he sings, his tail droops, but when he is
bustling about on every-day business he
is given to changing his attitude with the

sleek; up goes his tail; he jumps; he flashes

his trunk-searching at the base of the tree;
he ascends spirally, searching carefully as he jerks along and when he

begin his ascent again.</p>

<p>The Nuthatch&rsquo;s habit of perching and
hopping, upside down, on tree-trunks is
unmistakable. Actually, he seems to prefer
to eat his food thus, making it proper
to say, perhaps, that he <i>eats his caterpillars</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
<i>up</i>. He may realize that the creepers, woodpeckers, and Black and
White Warblers, working upward as they do, find the insects which
can be seen from below or from the side, while he prefers to investigate
the crannies that these other birds may pass by.</p>
<p>This neighborly winter bird visits the food-counter regularly and
is very fond of suet. He has the habit of hiding food in the bark of
trees. I once saw a Nuthatch thus hoarding sunflower seeds. At
least a full hour he worked, hiding dozens of the little kernels. He
was watched <i>and followed</i> by a pair of lazy Downy Woodpeckers
who deliberately ate the seeds as fast as the Nuthatch could hide
them. The Nuthatch, it appeared, has great faith in his ability to
hide food where it cannot be found&mdash;so great a faith, in fact, that
he did not properly guard his store.</p>
<p>He calls <i>drrr, drrr, drrr</i> in a nasal voice, as he busies himself
with pounding at a bit of food. As he looks out from the trunk his
neck is bent from his body at even more than a right angle, yet he
does not seem to tire of these strained attitudes.</p>

<p>The Red-breasted Nuthatch&rsquo;s mouselike body seems strangely
small as it moves about the great trunk of a high hemlock, far from
the ground. As it disappears behind the tree, we hear its querulous,
complaining <i>n&#259;, n&#259;, n&#259;</i>, as it searches for insects. During migration
it is often to be seen about the outer twigs where it sometimes hangs
upside down, like a Chickadee. On the tree-trunks its actions are
much the same as those of its larger relative, the White-breasted
Nuthatch. (See illustration, <a href="#Page_153">page 153</a>.)</p>

<p>In winter, Chickadees may visit the lunch-counter daily; but in
summer, when the duties of family-rearing are pressing, they may
not be seen for weeks at a time. For this reason they are frequently

<p>The soft, brief warble of the Bluebird in
spring, and the gentle farewell it sings in the
fall as it flies over, are to be classed among the
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
sweetest of bird music, to my way of thinking. The Bluebird is not
only beautiful in song and in color, but it is decidedly beneficial,
and since it rears two or three broods of young a year, when it can,
it destroys much insect life in feeding the hungry young which eat
proportionately more than their parents.</p>
<p>The Bluebird&rsquo;s interesting habit of lifting its wing after alighting,
or as it sings, is characteristic.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
